# libc

`libc` is a javascript framework which allows to create fast and robust applications.
It has been highly inspired by [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
architectures and [Mithrill](http://mithril.js.org) library.

## Build

Prior to building a library, you'll need to install development tools: `npm install`.

To build libc with ES6 syntax use `npm run-script build`. To build one with ES5 syntax use `npm run-script build-es5`.

## Examples

All the examples could be found in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/shybovycha/libc.js/tree/master/examples) directory.
